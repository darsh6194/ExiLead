## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Complete pipeline - scrape and save to database
python automated_scraper.py

# Check current database statistics
python automated_scraper.py --stats-only
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Custom companies file
python automated_scraper.py --companies my_companies.json

# Scrape only, no database save
python automated_scraper.py --no-auto-save

# Keep JSON results after database save
python automated_scraper.py --keep-json
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Setup database schema
python database_setup.py --setup

# Test database connection
python database_setup.py --test

# Show database statistics
python database_setup.py --info
```

### Testing & Demo
```bash
# Run demo with sample data
python demo_pipeline.py

# Test duplicate prevention
python demo_pipeline.py --test-duplicates

# Quick system setup
python quick_setup.py
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created
- **`companies`**: Company information with job counts
- **`jobs`**: Detailed job postings with AI-enhanced categorization
- **`company_job_stats`** (View): Analytics by company
- **`category_stats`** (View): Job distribution by category
- **`recent_jobs`** (View): Recently added positions

### Key Features
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Proper data normalization
- **Unique Constraints**: Duplicate prevention at database level
- **Automatic Triggers**: Job count updates and timestamp management
- **JSON Storage**: Flexible storage for arrays (skills, requirements, etc.)
- **Indexed Queries**: Optimized for fast searches and analytics

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Smart Duplicate Prevention
```python
def job_exists(self, apply_link):
    """Check if job already exists in database"""
    with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM jobs WHERE apply_link = %s", (apply_link,))
        return cursor.fetchone() is not None
```

### AI-Powered Categorization
```python
def categorize_job(self, title, description):
    """Categorize job based on title and description"""
    # Software Development, Data & Analytics, DevOps & Infrastructure,
    # Product & Design, Sales & Marketing, Operations, Other
    return category
```

### Batch Processing Efficiency
```python
def save_jobs_batch(self, jobs_list):
    """Save multiple jobs with comprehensive statistics"""
    # Processes jobs in batches with detailed progress tracking
    # Returns comprehensive statistics for monitoring
```
